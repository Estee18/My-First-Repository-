My-First-Repository-
Welcome to my first GitHub repository!
This is a simple test project to help me learn how to use GitHub. I created this repo to practice creating, editing, and committing files.
What I plan to do here
- Learn Git and GitHub basics
- Add sample files and code
- Experiment with commits and branches
Thanks for visiting!
